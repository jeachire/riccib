Description: This package contains a function called `riccibo`, which allows the
    estimation of the parameters of a Ricci model using a Bayesian approach with
    Jeffreys' non-informative prior. To start using the `riccib` package and the
    `riccibo` function, you need to install it from the GitHub repository
    <https://github.com/jeachire/riccib>. Additionally, you need to install the
    following dependencies from CRAN: `MCMCpack`, `coda`, and `VGAM`. For more
    details about the `riccibo` function and how to use it, please refer to the
    documentation at <https://jeachire.github.io/riccib/reference/riccibo.html>.
